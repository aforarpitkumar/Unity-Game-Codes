/* 
Unlike button presses, the mouse movement is measured by the amount the mouse has moved since the
last frame only. Basically, holding a key will cause a value to increase until it maxes out at â€“1 or 1
(depending on whether is it positive or negative). The mouse movement, however, will generally
have smaller numbers because it is measured and reset every frame.
